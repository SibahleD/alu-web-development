                <h1>Watching The Party Die; The Aftermath</h1>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q67kDkmKkzQ"><img src="https://images.genius.com/c530b9c4fb9ce2f8ec884bc4e8101097.1000x897x1.jpg" alt="Link To The Song" style="width:500px;height:500px;"></a>
                <h1>"God give me life, God give me peace..."</h1>
                <p>On the evening of 9/11, a day that commemmorates  the large loss of life incurred by American folks 23 years ago, as i scroll past Instagram for what i claim is the last time before i sleep, i get a notification from Twitter with three simple, but riveting, words, 
                "Kendrick Just Dropped". I franticly jumped to every concievable profile of his to search for this new drop, ffinding it in Instagram, the very app i was just on, to be met with an image of a used pair of black Air Force Ones. Beuddled, i clicked on this image, and 
                there it was, the new song. I heard the strings fade in and the vocal sample enter, and instantly knew this song wasn't a "Not Like Us" rerun, but an errie song with similar vibes to 6:16 in LA, a song also exclusive to IG, which served as a warning shot to K-Dot's 
                adversary, Drake.This was definetley a track to sit down to dissect and digest on. So i listened, and as the track went on it became very clear what message he wanted to send to the industry. He wanted to bring rap back to its former glory, and had no issue getting 
                blood on his hands to do it. </p>
                <h2>"God keep these lame -redacted- away frrom me"</h2>
                <p>It is glaringly obvious that in the opening remarks of the song, K-Dot directed his atention to Drake, who had suffered a large loss in the diss back-and-forth with him, and as such suffers from a commercial downfall.He seems to move on from the initial battle, 
                calling drake "whacked and disqualified". He also speaks of a larger party with similar interests and aspects as Drake, calling them clowns and bound to certain death (whether mortal or commercial is still unsure). He brings back the notion of being content with 
                being hated by the large populous, but claims the reason is beccause of influental people painting him as such for their own nefarious motives, and their hatred for "what he represents". He is also disgusted by these same people, claiming that even women have a 
                hard time dealing with such people, and wishes he could trade them for the late Nipsey Hustle, a well regarded and respected igure in Hip-Hop</p>
                <h3>"Dear God, draw the line, they tryna confuse em with me"</h3>
                <p>He revels in 'watching the party die, which is ominous considering this song was published just as the MTV VMAs started broadcasting. He contemplates getting rid of the negative elements of hip-hop culture, and bringing shame to the families of those who pushed 
                these agendas. He strongly feels that the "culture" would be better of without them</p>
